JHU Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Final ProjectPrepared by B. Kavalar 24 July 2017Codebook.md ContentThis codebook describes the dataset used and the processing needed to clean the set, along with the resulting variables and description of the final tidy data set provided for the assignmentDatasets provided by UCII first downloaded the zip file of the datasets for the project from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zipBelow is a decription of the data set files from UCIHuman Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws www.smartlab.wsThe experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See ‘features_info.txt’ for more details.For each record it is provided:Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.Its activity label.An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.The dataset includes the following files:‘README.txt’‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.‘features.txt’: List of all features.‘activity_labels.txt’: Links the class labels with their activity name.‘train/X_train.txt’: Training set.‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels.‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set.‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels.The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.‘train/subject_train.txt’: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.‘train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt’: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units ‘g’. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the ‘total_acc_x_train.txt’ and ‘total_acc_z_train.txt’ files for the Y and Z axis.‘train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt’: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.‘train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt’: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.Notes:Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].Each feature vector is a row on the text file.Processing performed on UCI datasetsSince these files were all text files I needed to import them into Excel to create .csv filesI read files for X, Y, and Subject Test into Excel from the provided UCI text filesx_test is the raw data results for each subject with 561 variables per rowy_test shows what activity was being performed during each sample per rowsubject_test is the subject number in the sample run - 1-30 subjects (people) for each row of dataThese files were saved as csv files for easier processing in R.This process was repeated for the train data set:I read files for X, Y, and Subject Test into Excel from the provided UCI text filesx_train is the raw data results for each subject with 561 variables per rowy_train shows what activity was being performed during each sample per rowsubject_train is the subject number in the sample run - 1-30 subjects (people) for each row of dataThese files were saved as csv files for easier processing in R.I then read in the features file provided by UCI. I then used expressions to remove leading numbers from the feature names and used this add correct column names to the X_Test and X_Train files.I then subsetted / filtered the X_Test and X_Train files to only use columns with mean or std in the name.Next I used the UCI activity lables.txt to rename the Y_Test and Y_Train column data to more descriptive names in the activity labels files. This resulted in using descriptive names using the activity labels where: 1=WALKING, 2=WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3=WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4=SITTING, 5=STANDING, 6=LAYING so it was easier to understand the data later.I then performed a cbind on the three dataset files X, Y, and Subject for test and train into a single files for test and train later processing.I then renamed the column headers in both the filtered test and train files for the subject number, activity type.Once these test and train datasets were filtered and columns renamed I merged the two datasets to form a combined final dataset for processing for mean and standard deviation. I reordered the merged dataset on subject number and activity type to unify the datase related to those variables. The subject number was selected first then I sorted on the activity type.We now have a merged dataset that we can process to find mean and standard deviation values related to the six activity types for each of the 30 subject numbers.I used a for loop to process the mean and standard deviation each of the subject numbers during each loop. During each loop colMeans was run. Since colMeans only works on numberic data I need to remove the columns for subject number and activity type before running the mean. However, colMeans created a single column of data and I then needed to transpose this information into required columns of data for each subject number run. Once the data was transposed I recombined into a single data set for each of the six activity types for the given subject number. Then I added back in the columns for subject number and activity type.Final Tidy Data Set CreatedThe resultant data created six rows for each subject number since there are six activities. I used colMeans to find the overall values for each variable. This data was recursively written to a saved data file for each subject number 1-30. The resultand data file has the format for columns and rows shown below with 180 rows of data: Column 1: | Column 2: | Columns 3-64: Subject Number | Activity Types | Calculated Mean                |
